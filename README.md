# Mod Helper - Craft Orders
Avorion mod that provides a way for modders to add new Orders to the Craft Orders Window without overriding "initUI" function (and because of this, allowing to make mods that don't conflict with each other).
Allows to add AIActions, their icons and brings some useful vanilla functions like "checkCaptain" and "removeSpecialOrders".
It also makes some adjustments, removing order icons from ships after player entered them or they jumped into another sector.
