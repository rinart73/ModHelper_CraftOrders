# ModHelper_CraftOrders
Provides a way for modders to add new Orders to the Avorion UI without overriding "initUI" function (and because of this, making mods that don't conflict with each other). It also allows add AIActions, their icons and brings some useful vanilla local functions like "checkCaptain" and "removeSpecialOrders".
